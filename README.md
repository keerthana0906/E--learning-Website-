## Course Details
### 1. Computational Systems Biology : Deep Learning in Life Sciences
   * **Link to course** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; https://mit6874.github.io/ 
   * **Offered By** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; MIT 
   * **Pre-Requisites** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp;  Calculus, Linear Algebra, Python programming,Probability,   
                                     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Introductory molecular biology
   * **Level** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced
   * **Course description**    
        This course introduces foundations and state-of-the-art machine learning challenges in genomics and the life sciences more broadly. We introduce both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches to key problems, comparing and contrasting their power and limitations. We seek to enable students to evaluate a wide variety of solutions to key problems we face in this rapidly developing field, and to execute on new enabling solutions that can have large impact. As part of the subject students will implement solutions to challenging problems, first in problem sets that span a carefully chosen set of tasks, and then in an independent project. Students will program using Python 3 and TensorFlow 2 in Jupyter Notebooks, a nod to the importance of carefully documenting your work so it can be precisely reproduced by others.
 

### 2. Computational Genomics
   * **Link to course** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs262/cgi-bin/index.php 
   * **Offered By** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; Stanford 
   * **Pre-Requisites** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
   * **Level** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced
   * **Course description**    
        Genomics is a new and very active application area of computer science. The past ten years there has been an explosion of genomics data -- the entire DNA sequences of several organisms, including human, are now available. These are long strings of base pairs (A,C,G,T) containing all the information necessary for an organism's development and life. Computer science is playing a central role in genomics: from sequencing and assembling of DNA sequences to analyzing genomes in order to locate genes, repeat families, similarities between sequences of different organisms, and several other applications. The area of computational genomics includes both applications of older methods, and development of novel algorithms for the analysis of genomic sequences. This course aims to present some of the most basic and useful algorithms for sequence analysis, together with the minimal biological background necessary for a computer science student to appreciate their application to current genomics research. Sequence alignments, hidden Markov models, multiple alignment algorithms and heuristics such as Gibbs sampling, and the probabilistic interpretation of alignments will be covered. Applications of these tools to sequence analysis will be presented: comparing genomes of different species, gene finding, gene regulation, whole genome sequencing and assembly. Whenever possible, examples will be drawn from the most current developments in genomics research.
