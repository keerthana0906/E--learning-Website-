        * **Course description** 
             This course introduces foundations and state-of-the-art machine learning challenges    
             in genomics and the life sciences more broadly. We introduce both deep learning and    
             classical machine learning approaches to key problems, comparing and contrasting their   
             power and limitations.    We seek to enable students to evaluate a wide variety of solutions   
             to key problems we face in this rapidly developing field, and to execute on new enabling    
             solutions that can have large impact. As part of the subject students will implement solutions    
             to challenging problems, first in problem sets that span a carefully chosen set of tasks,    
             and then in an independent project. Students will program using Python 3 and TensorFlow 2    
             in Jupyter Notebooks, a nod to the importance of carefully documenting your work so it can be   
             precisely reproduced by others.
